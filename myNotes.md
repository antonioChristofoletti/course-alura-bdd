# BDD

## What is It?

It is a software development technic in which the idea is that the whole team uses a common language to discuss and document the behaviors, rules and acceptance scenarios related to the software features.

Reunite the technical team and non technical team in order to define behaviors nd key points of the application, and then, start the developement.

The BDD scenarios can be use in the TDD and test automation.

## Motivation:

- Improve and make easier the communication between the team;
- Make a software demands people with different backgrounds and this can be make the communication hard;
- Help the whole team understand the rules and behaviors of the system.

## How to use
